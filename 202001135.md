Lab: 08 - Unit Testing with JUnit

Lab Exercises

1. At first, I created new java project in ecllipse with name Lab8_202001135 and created a package named lab8 inside it.

2. Then I created a class named Boa and added the provided code.

3. Then I created JUnit test file for the Boa class having name BoaTest.

4. Then I modified the setUp method to initialize the variables.

5. Then I implemented tests for the given two functions testIsHealthy() and testFitsInCage().

For testing thee fitsInCage() function, I haven't wrote tests for both jen and ken objects as the function is same for both objects. Output of test cases depends only comparison of given length to actual length of object. The behaviour will be similar in both cases.

6. Then I ran the Junit test file and both the tests are passed.

7. Then I added a new method lenghtInInches() which multiplies the given length with 12 and returns to the Boa class.

8. Then I wrote test case for this new method and ran the 3 test cases together.
